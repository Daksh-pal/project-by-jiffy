            Hello, my name is Daksh Pal, a final-year B.Tech student, excited to present my project for Jiffy Softwareâ€”a dynamic web application built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Express.

        <br /><br /><br />
 
            <h6 className=" font-bold mb-4 text-center">Objective</h6>

            The objective was to create a feature-rich website with user registration, login functionality, and a personalized profile section. This project showcases my skills in front-end development using React, UI design with Tailwind CSS, and back-end integration with Express.
            
            <br /><br /><br />
            <h6 className=" font-bold mb-4 text-center">Tech Stack</h6>

            I utilized the powerful React library for dynamic and responsive user interfaces, complemented by the styling prowess of Tailwind CSS for a sleek and modern design. The back-end was powered by Express, ensuring seamless communication between the client and server.
            <br /><br /><br />
            <h6 className=" font-bold mb-4 text-center">Deadline</h6>
            
            Despite the tight deadline of 12:30, I successfully completed the project on time along with the decoration of temple on the ocassion of Ram Mandir. This highlights my ability to efficiently manage tasks and deliver quality work within stipulated deadlines. Thank you for your time.
